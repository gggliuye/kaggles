using YOLO network except changing the last layer to 24 outputs values.
Using mean_squared_error for the first test, I will switch to the yolo_loss latter.
#### Test1 batch size 32, 40 epochs
result in 0.00 score
- problem of submission ?
- problem of loss function

#### Test1 batch size 32, 30 epochs
- using personal defined yolo like loss.
- the loss of training and validation are not coverging.
- result in 0.00 score.
- next will be train on pertrained yolo weights.
- if the upper change note work, will switch to segmaentation methods.
